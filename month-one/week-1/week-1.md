## Week One - Start with the Basics

**REMINDER: This might take more than a week for you and that is FINE! The word 'week' here is very loose.**

I think it's important to have some wins right off the bat. Instead of downloading a ton of stuff and seeing the benefits from that hours/days from now, we're going to jump right in with some coding.

You’re going to dive into HTML, CSS

Read this awesome [article](https://generalassemb.ly/blog/website-is-like-a-house/) from general assembly to get a brief overview about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If that articles doesn't speak to you, here's another you can [read](https://blog.codeanalogies.com/2018/05/09/the-relationship-between-html-css-and-javascript-explained/).

Reading articles like this when I started out really helped me to clarify the differences between HTML, CSS and JS.

### HTML

Quickly read through HTML basics [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics).

We're going to jump right into building a few things through freecodecamp.

**NOTE - You don't have to do all of the following assignments. You can select exercises, reading, or video. Whichever works best for your learning style.**
