### Quiz 2 HTML & CSS - Applying what you've learned

Let's work on creating our first simple HTML and CSS page.

Running code in the browser through freeCodeCamp or CodePen is great. But you’ll need to start running code on your computer as a developer. When I was teaching myself how to code, I hated coding in things like codepen or in the browser with freeCodeCamp. I loved what I learned. But I wanted to code like a real developer did. And that was difficult to start doing.

I want you to start doing that right away. And start learning the tools you need to know like the terminal, and a text editor right away.

We'll work on that now!

#### Exercise

Create an index.html file and a CSS file. Import the CSS file in the HTML file. Add a h1 tag and write "Hello World" in it. Change the h1 tag to your favorite color.

**Note:** If you feel confident in this exercise, don't read the steps below. But if you don't feel confident completing the exercise yet, read the steps below! They don't answer everything but they'll walk you through most of what you need to do.

**Steps**
Note - I'll be uploading a video walkthrough on my channel as well!
1. Create a new directory (hint.. `mkdir yourDirectoryName`) where we'll create the files for our small project. If you feel more comfortable creating this manually on your computer, that's fine too.
2. Create a file index.html (hint.. `touch index.html`). (If you feel more comfortable just creating a file in vscode, atom, or sublime, that's ok too!)
3. Create a file `stylesheet.css` in the same directory as the file above
4. Add a head and body in your html file<br>
5. Add the link to your stylesheet in your head file

```
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css" media="screen"/>
</head>
```
6. Now, add a body tag.
7. Add a header inside the body. Hint, search for `<h1>`.
8. Write Hello World inside the h1 tag.
9. Make the header your favorite color using CSS

**Want the answers?** The answers can be found in this directory in the exercise-1 folder.

Next, let’s learn about JavaScript.

# Intro to JavaScript

JavaScript is tough. It's not easy to just pick it up and start coding. We're going to start with some basics. Don't feel bad if this takes awhile to learn.

We're going to foucs on creating variables, storing values in them, and adding numbers first.

Here's an intro [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk) about JavaScript! Mosh is an awesome teacher and has some very high quality videos about JS.

## Assignment

Reminder - Pick the option that best matches your learning style. You **don't** need to complete everything below.

### Reading

- [ ] [JavaScript for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk) - If you didn't watch it already (see above), I highly recommend you spend some time watching this video.

### Exercises - Complete the following JavaScript freeCodeCamp lessons
- [ ] [Declare javascript variables](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/declare-javascript-variables)
- [ ] [Storing values with the assignment operator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/storing-values-with-the-assignment-operator)

Great. I really just wanted you to get started with some coding to show you some of the cool stuff you can do as a frontend developer.

Stay tuned for week 4!
